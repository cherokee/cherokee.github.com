<div class="paragraph"><p>The <em>Upload Progress</em> plug-in provides feedback to the web browser
about the status of an ongoing POST request.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To make it more convenient, it is implemented so that you don’t have
to change a single line of code in your applications. It is compatible
with Lighttpd’s mod_uploadprogress, Nginx’s
NginxHttpUploadProgressModule, and Apache’s equivalent, so chances are
you’ll be able to do a seamless migration.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To make use of the plugin you’ll need some code on the client
side. Many Javascript snippets and Flash modules are available for
free. The
<a href="http://github.com/drogus/jquery-upload-progress">jQuery-upload-progress</a>
module has given fairly good results in the past, but there are many
other options available.</p></div>
