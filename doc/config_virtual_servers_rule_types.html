<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>There are many types of rules available on Cherokee, and each one
allows you to define specific ways of matching HTTP requests. Further
more, the behavior can be combined by defining complex rules that
apply boolean operations to the basic rule types, so the possibilities
are endless. Some times a specific behavior can be achieved following
completely different paths: for instance, you can match the requests
for a specific file type either by using the <tt>Extensions</tt> rule type or
the <tt>Regular Expressions</tt> type. Be advised that some rule types are
inherently more efficient than others, so you should stick to the
simplest and fastest approach.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is the list of available rule types:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Directory</strong>: The entry Directory encloses a group of directives which will
    apply only to the named directory and sub-directories of that directory.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Extensions</strong>: The entry Extensions doesn’t care about directories, it will
    just look for the extension of the object requested.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Regular Expressions</strong>: The Request entry provides a powerful way to apply
    custom options to requests. It is a complement for the Directory and Extension
    entries. Basically, there are two differences between them:
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
It uses regular expressions to define the requests in which the configuration
      will be applied.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
These entries are able to use the connection parameters (both pathinfo
      and query string). In this way it is possible to set rules based on
      parameter values.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Header</strong>: This type of rule is used to modify the behavior in
      response to the contents of HTTP headers. A regular expression
      is needed to match against. This kind of rule can be used to
      provide alternative contents to a specific type of users. For
      example, it can check if the HTTP referer header refferences
      specific domains to allow or deny the delivery of the requested
      information.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>File Exists</strong>: This type of rule will only be applied if a
      certain file (or a file among a list of provided file names) is
      present. An I/O cache specific setting for the rule can be
      configured in the <tt>Rule</tt> tab. If enabled, it will speed up the
      file detection during the rule evaluation. This improves
      performance but is not recommended when the directory contents
      change dynamically. This type of rule can also be used to match
      any file. For example, it can be configured to serve static
      files and fall through to another rule if the HTTP request is
      for a resource of dynamic nature.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>HTTP method</strong>: These rules are applied whenever the selected HTTP
      method is used. You can configure these to respond to a request
      of type GET, POST, HEAD, PUT, OPTIONS, DELETE, TRACE, CONNECT,
      COPY, LOCK, MKCOL, MOVE, NOTIFY, POLL, PROPFIND, PROPPATCH,
      SEARCH, SUBSCRIBE, UNLOCK or UNSUBSCRIBE.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Incoming IP/Port</strong>: If the server is running on several ports,
      this rule type will let you specify to which port’s pettitions
      will it apply.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>SSL / TLS</strong>: This rule type is applied to incomming HTTPS
      connections.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Full Path</strong>: Full path request to which content the
      configuration will be applied. This means you can pinpoint a
      list of files that will be specifically targeted by this rule
      type.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Connected from</strong>: will let you discriminate connections based on
      the IP or SubNet from which these are originated.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>URL Argument</strong>: will allow you to match a Regular Expressions to
      the URL arguments, be it a specific one or any of the possible
      arguments.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>GeoIP</strong>: If GeoIP support is present, this type of rules can be
      added. The GeoIP library has to be present at build time for
      this to happen. If enabled, specific behavior can be offered
      depending on the country of origin of the requests to the web
      server. Note that the country is determined by matching the IPs
      to the actual list of countries handled by the library, so the
      usage of proxies on the user side will render this resolution
      mechanism inaccurate. An initial country must be added to the
      rule, and more selections can be added in further steps.
