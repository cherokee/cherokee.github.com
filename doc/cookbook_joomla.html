<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Setting up <a href="http://www.joomla.org/">Joomla</a> with Cherokee is really
easy. Joomla is offered through the Cherokee Market and can be
automatically installed as a new dedicated Virtual Server, or to set
it up inside a Directory.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This recipe contains sections detailing how to:
. Configure Cherokee for either installation mode using the Market.
. Install Joomla v1.5.14 which is the last one available at the time
of writing.
. Configure Cherokee manually.</p></div>
<h3 id="market_configuration">Configure Cherokee using the Market</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The easiest way is to look for the application in the Market and
follow the point and click interface.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>However, these are the steps for those wanting to install it manually.</p></div>
<h3 id="manual_configuration">Configuring Cherokee manually</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The Market can handle both series of Joomla, 1.5.x and 1.6.x. This manual
process was documented for 1.5.x and might not work for 1.6.x.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You will need PHP support correctly configured in Cherokee, and PHP
with the MySQL module installed. For this you will require php-cgi
installed on your system, and to run the PHP wizard, so in case it is
not configured yet you an follow the appropriate recipe about
<a href="cookbook_php.html">setting up PHP</a>. You will also need an FTP
server if the Joomla files are owned by a user other than the one
running the web server.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Under these conditions, you could start Joomla’s installation and you
would already be able to have your site up and running.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>However, we can add several refinements. In this recipe we will be
dedicating a virtual server entirely to Joomla, so either create a new
one or adjust <tt>default</tt> accordingly. Of course, you can also set it up
under a directory in an existing virtual server, but we will take the
first approach for clarity and simplicity.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For our purposes, we will make the modifications in our <tt>default</tt>
virtual server. This will only affect the URLs we’ll be accessing to
log in to Joomla. First download and uncompress the distributed Joomla
release into <tt>/var/www/joomla</tt>, and set that path as the <tt>Document
Root</tt> in your virtual host’s <tt>Basics</tt> tab.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We will also be making changes in the <tt>Error Handler</tt> tab, selecting
the <tt>Custom redirections</tt> option and adding an option to send errors
to Joomla.</p></div>
<div class="tableblock">
<table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" frame="border" rules="all" width="100%">
<col width="50%"></col>
<col width="50%"></col>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left" valign="top">Error         </th>
<th align="left" valign="top">URL</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top"><p class="table">403 Forbidden</p></td>
<td align="left" valign="top"><p class="table">/index.php</p></td>

<td align="left" valign="top"><p class="table">404 Not Found</p></td>
<td align="left" valign="top"><p class="table">/index.php</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Finally, set up the rewrite rules recommended by Joomla to block out
the most common type of exploit attempts. To do so, simply create
<tt>Regular Expression</tt> rules for the following expressions:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>mosConfig_[a-zA-Z_]{1,21}(=|\%3D)
base64_encode.*\(.*\)
(\&lt;|%3C).*script.*(\&gt;|%3E)
GLOBALS(=|\[|\%[0-9A-Z]{0,2})
_REQUEST(=|\[|\%[0-9A-Z]{0,2})</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Each should be managed by a handler that returns an error:</p></div>
<div class="tableblock">
<table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" frame="border" rules="all" width="100%">
<col width="50%"></col>
<col width="50%"></col>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left" valign="top">Handler    </th>
<th align="left" valign="top">Error</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top"><p class="table">HTTP error</p></td>
<td align="left" valign="top"><p class="table">403 Forbidden</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>After this you are done! Remember that all these settings are
refinements not really needed by Joomla to perform its basic
functions.</p></div>
<h3 id="package_installation">Installing Joomla</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Both Cheroee and the system have to be prepared for Joomla to be
installed. The database issue can be taken care of with the following
steps. Log in to MySQL:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>mysql -u root -p</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>And create the database for Joomla. We will be using the name
<em>joomla</em>, the user <em>joomlauser</em> and the password <em>joomlapassword</em>, but
you should set up your own.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>CREATE DATABASE joomla;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON joomla.* TO joomlauser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'joomlapassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON joomla.* TO joomlauser@localhost.localdomain IDENTIFIED BY 'joomlapassword';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
quit;</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Then point your web browser to <tt>http://localhost/joomla</tt> and follow
the instructions provided by the Joomla installer.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There is not much else you must do for Cherokee to work with
Joomla. If you follow the Joomla installer’s instructions -providing
valid database information in most cases will suffice-, you will go
thorough every step swiftly. Once you are done you will have to
eliminate the <tt>installation</tt> subdirectory, as Joomla does not allow
going any further until you do so as a security precaution. It is also
a good idea to make the <tt>cache</tt> directory world writable.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>rm -rf /var/www/joomla/installation
chmod 777 /var/www/joomla/cache</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img alt="media/images/cookbook_joomla.png" src="media/images/cookbook_joomla.png"/>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Now to set up Joomla. Visit
<a href="http://localhost/administration">http://localhost/administration</a>
and log in. Go to the <tt>Global Configuration</tt> option and enable all the
<strong>SEO Settings</strong>, including the ones for Apache mod_rewrite.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Mission accomplished!</p></div>
