<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>For this recipe we will be using
<a href="http://www.sugarcrm.com/crm/download/sugar-suite.html">Sugar
Community Edition 5.5</a>, which is the latest freely distributable
edition available at the
<a href="http://www.sugarcrm.com/crm/download/sugar-suite.html">download
site</a> when this was written.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <tt>Full installation package</tt> will be enough. No need to use the
bulky complete stacks. We just need PHP support correctly configured
in Cherokee, and PHP with the MySQL module installed. The default
configuration already provides a valid PHP configuration for Cherokee
if you have php-cgi installed, but you can follow the appropriate
recipe about <a href="cookbook_php.html">setting up PHP</a> in case you don’t
have it available for any reason.</p></div>
<h3 id="cherokee">Adjusting Cherokee</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You can either read through this whole section to install it manually,
or you can follow the recommended method and use the provided
installation Wizard.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To do this, you’ll have to locate the Wizard, available for
installation under a subdirectory or using a new dedicated virtual
server. In both cases you’ll find a Wizard option: For the former
you’ll have to access the Wizard from the list of available ones
within the <tt>Virtual Servers</tt> section of Cherokee-Admin, clicking on
the <tt>Add</tt> button at the top of the panel. The latter is accessed
through the same list of Wizards, this time using the <tt>Rule
Management</tt> button within the <tt>Behavior</tt> tab of any given virtual
server. Once the panel with the rules is listed, follow a similar
procedure using the <tt>Add</tt> button located at the top.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Once the Wizard list is visible, simply go to the <tt>Misc</tt>
section, click on <tt>Sugar</tt>, provide the basic information and you can
skip the rest of this section and jump directly to
<a href="cookbook_sugarcrm.html#installation">Package installation</a></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you choose not to follow the recommended method, you’ll just have
to go through these steps:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>First, create the directory that will be used when installing
SugarCRM.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt># mkdir /var/www/sugar</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Then launch Cherokee-Admin on your system, and set the created path as
<tt>Document web root</tt> of your <tt>default</tt> virtual server. This is done
through the <tt>Basics</tt> tab of the mentioned virtual server.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The only other thing to do with Cherokee is recreate the SugarCRM
restrictions coded in the <tt>.htaccess</tt> file. Those are mere
redirections put in place to avoid users from accessing certain
files. If it is not yet populated, it will after the installation. You
should check it out to account for cases not covered in the following
rules.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We will have to create several rules in our virtual server to cover
the whole list of banned files. This list is loosely based on the one
provided by <tt>.htaccess</tt>.</p></div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>These need to be created as <tt>Regular Expression</tt> type rules matching
the expressions of the list. The rules must be managed by the
<tt>Redirection</tt> handler, and you will need to specify only the type and
substitution to perform. The regular expression is inherited, so no
need to re-type it.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Of course you can also add as many rewriting rules as you wish to
beautify your URLs, but those will have to be analyzed on an
individual base.</p></div>
<h3 id="installation">Package installation</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Uncompress SugarCRM to your web document root and rename the directory
to whatever you like. We will choose <tt>/var/www/sugar</tt> as installation
directory for this recipe.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Then remember setting up file permissions. Some files and directories
need to be writable by the user that runs Cherokee. Those are:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
cache
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
custom
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
data
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
modules
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
config.php
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>By simply accessing the configured virtual host, the installer will
start. Since we have modified our <tt>default</tt> virtualhost, we can access
visiting <tt>http://localhost</tt>.</p></div>

</div>
<div class="image-title">Commencing installation</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You’ll need to Accept the license agreement before you can go on, and
once you’ve done this the installer will run the compatibility checks.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Select <tt>Typical</tt> installation, choose the MySQL database, fill in
the required data and if everything went smoothly, the installer
should create the database and go through with the whole process.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Here is where you will see which requirements are not met. Most
probably you will have to make some minor adjustments.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In this case we had to modify some values in the <tt>php.ini</tt> file to
provide higher memory limits and allow bigger files to be
uploaded. Remember that it is likely you will have several of those in
your system, each one for its own PHP: the CGI version, the CLI,
etc. Cherokee uses PHP through FastCGI, so edit that one with your
favorite editor.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">Editing the PHP configuration</div>
<div class="content">
<pre><tt># editor /etc/php5/cgi/php.ini</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="sidebar-content">
<div class="sidebar-title">Required adjustments in this case</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>memory_limit = 40M</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>upload_max_filesize = 8M</p></div>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To see the changes reflected in the installer you would have to
respawn the php instances. Simply kill them and Cherokee will do the
rest.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If something is still not supported, it will prompt you so you can
change it before you proceed.</p></div>

<div class="image-title">Warnings</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For this example we will not be needing <tt>IMAP</tt>, so we will disregard the
warning. After proceeding with the process we should be presented with
the login page.</p></div>
