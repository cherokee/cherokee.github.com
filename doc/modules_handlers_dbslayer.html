<div class="paragraph"><p>This handler offers a lightweight database abstraction layer that
will provide all the benefits of connection pooling. This in turn
offers scalable advantages for high-load websites.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The original implementation of
<a href="http://code.nytimes.com/projects/dbslayer/">DBSlayer</a> was a MySQL
to JSON over HTTP bridge. This handler outperforms any other
implementation by far,  and many more advantages are derived of using
the MySQL bridge, including:</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
Possibility of being proxied: imagine caching your database queries
with any standard mechanism currently in place.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Chunked encoding: make your database connections persistent between
the bridge and the database server. Experience a huge performance
boost independently of your application’s design.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Possibility of applying any of the encoding modules provided by
Cherokee: deliver your database results in gzipped format and save
bandwidth.
</p>
</li>

<p>
More languages available: besides JSON, the handler can also return
the information to be used directly by Python, Ruby and PHP.

<div class="paragraph"><p>Note that for this module to be correctly compiled, the MySQL database
development files are required.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>As stated above, the MySQL bridge handler is merely an abstraction
layer. An excellent one at that, but that is all. No more, no less.
This means you can perform regular operations on your database, but
you cannot expect magic to happen. For instance, when you perform an
INSERT, the Cherokee DB balancer will return a tuple indicating
whether it succeeded or not, the number of rows affected, a rollback
flag, etc. It will not, however, replicate the operation among each
one of you MySQL servers. These arrangements must be made
independently using MySQL’s specific mechanisms.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Since the handler can manage multiple SQL requests in the same
instruction, a list of responses is delivered containing as many as
commands were issued.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Warning: When performing multiple operations in a single call to the
handler, you need to keep one <strong>very important</strong> thing in mind.  Because
of MySQL’s design, when an error is returned no other statements are
executed. Check MySQL’s mysql_next_result() function for more details
about this limitation. This is not just limited to transactions. This
means you should make atomic calls to the handler if you want to
determine precisely what SQL commands where performed. A multiple
operation can be executed with no further issue, but if one of the
group fails the rest will not be run. You will receive at least one
error among the results, which is probably all what you need in case
you were in the middle of a transaction or that sort of situation.</p></div>

<a href="cookbook.html">cookbook</a> section, specifically in the recipe about
<a href="cookbook_dbslayer.html">setting up the MySQL balancing</a>.</p></div>
