<div class="paragraph"><p>Supporting <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/">ColdFusion</a>
with Cherokee is almost trivial.</p></div>
<h3 id="cherokee">Configuring Cherokee</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Cherokee provides a wizard that will assist you on this task. You can
either dedicate a new virtual server to the task, or use a preexisting
one. It is your choice, since the Wizard contemplates both scenarios.
For the former you’ll have to access the Wizard from the list of
available ones within the <tt>Virtual Servers</tt> panel. The latter is
accessed through the same list of Wizards of the <tt>Rule Management</tt>
panel. This panel is accessed by visiting the <tt>Behavior</tt> tab of the
selected virtual server, and triggering the <tt>Rule panel</tt> by clicking
on the <tt>Rule Management</tt> button. In either case, use the <tt>Add</tt> button
at the top of the panel to see the available wizards.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The wizard will simply ask for the host to be proxied and will set it
up for you to see. It will automatically detect if the provided
hostname:port are in fact running ColdFusion by probing for the
presence of the JRun service. Should you need to add more machines
to your cluster, you can add extra information sources to your
Cherokee configuration and let it deal with all the load balancing.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>No extra steps are necessary. If for any reason the Wizard doesn’t
work for you, you can always use the manual method described below.</p></div>
<h4 id="_manual_method">Manual method</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Getting Cherokee to work with ColdFusion (MX 6 versions and newer) is
simple and this emulates how tie-in is done with Apache and other
out-of-box supported web servers.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>ColdFusion (actually the JRUN Java server which Coldfusion runs on top
of) processes web requests by default on port 8500.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So create as many <tt>Information Sources</tt> running ColdFusion as needed
in Cherokee:</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Then, add a rule to your virtual server that is managed by the
<a href="modules_handlers_proxy.html">HTTP reverse proxy</a>, and assign the
above mentioned sources to it.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Round robin or IPHash will work for the balancer type. It is
recommended to stick with IPHash if you have multiple ColdFusion app
servers behind Cherokee so that session data will be preserved by
sending the user to the same backend always - thus eliminating
complicated and expensive load balancing solution to accomplish the
same.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>That’s all there is to this.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>One note: This is good for a single domain operation.  If you have
multiple sites that are to be handled by the same ColdFusion
backend(s) you will need to modify JRUN configuration files to handle
such.</p></div>
