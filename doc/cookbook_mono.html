<div class="paragraph"><p>To run ASP.NET applications with Cherokee, you will need to install
<a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a>. The Mono Project is a UNIX
version of the Microsoft .NET development platform aimed at enabling
UNIX developers to build and deploy cross-platform .NET Applications.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You will specifically need to run the <em>mono-fastcgi-server</em>, since
that is the backend needed to set up Cherokee with the FastCGI handler
to parse and compile aspx code.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You have several options available to obtain this.
If you are lucky enough, it will already be available in your favorite
platform.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>On Debian Lenny and Sid, and on Ubuntu 8.10+ (Intrepid and Jaunty) you
can simply leave to APT the trouble of setting up the dependencies by
typing:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt># apt-get install mono-fastcgi-server2</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The official supported packages can be found at
<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html">the download
site</a>. If your flavor is not there, for Linux you can either:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Download the binary installer, which is the
<a href="http://ftp.novell.com/pub/mono/archive/1.9.1/linux-installer/2/mono-1.9.1_2-installer.bin">release
1.9.1</a> at the time of writing,
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Download and compile the sources, available at the
<a href="http://ftp.novell.com/pub/mono/sources-stable/">sources page</a>. The
fastcgi-server is provided by the
<a href="http://ftp.novell.com/pub/mono/sources/xsp/xsp-2.0.tar.bz2">XSP</a> package.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You can find all sorts of information about the configuration of Mono
at the <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono Project</a> web site.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Once you have a FastCGI Mono backend available, we can proceed with
the recipe.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Since a Mono Wizard is shipped with Cherokee, the configuration is as
simple as clicking on the Wizard, located under the <tt>Languages</tt>
category, and filling up a few required fields. Your application
should be up and running. The rest of this document simply details the
the recipe that is emulated by the Wizard. If you have any trouble
with it, these steps could provide some insight on the reason of the
failure to function properly.</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><div class="title">Preparations</div><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
Define an <a href="config_info_sources.html">information source</a> that
  spawns the <em>fastcgi-mono-server</em>. In our example we will be binding
  it to the local interface, port 8080, with our application located
  in <tt>/var/www</tt>, which is our document root. It will be mapped to <tt>/</tt>
  by the FastCGI Mono Server. To do this, we will create a source
  called <em>mono</em>, and we will set up the interpreter as:
</p>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>fastcgi-mono-server2 --socket=tcp:8080 --address=127.0.0.1 --applications=/:/var/www</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Of course you could also define the parameters through environment
variables, and simply launch the interpreter as:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>fastcgi-mono-server2</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Lets assume we wanted to do so and also wished to use it through a
Unix socket instead of through a host:port combination. You would have
to define at least the following variables:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>MONO_FCGI_APPLICATIONS=/:/var/www
MONO_FCGI_SOCKET=unix
MONO_FCGI_FILENAME=/tmp/cherokee-mono.socket</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Make sure to set up a relatively high spawning timeout, because it can
take its time and you don’t want Cherokee giving up before the process
is spawned. A value of 30 seconds should suffice. Obviously this value
is way too high to serve contents when the FastCGI Mono backend has
not been spawned. It is only meant to be used a security
measure. Spawning the process before putting the server into
production is highly recommended.</p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Map your information source to a rule that handles your Mono
  application. This can be done by setting up the rule for extensions
  or paths.
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
The first alternative is easily achievable by passing the 11
    standard extensions to the FastCGI Mono Server, defining a rule
    that uses the information source we just mentioned and applies to
    the extensions: <tt>aspx, asmx, ashx, asax, ascx, soap, rem, axd, cs,
    config, dll</tt>. However, this is not the option recommended by the
    Mono Project since some undesired side effects are obtained, such
    as exposed files and missing features.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The second alternative overcomes this by sending all requests
    directly to the FastCGI Mono Server, but it comes at the cost of a
    performance decrease. It is the recommended option.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So, lets get started. The recipe will configure the FastCGI handler
using paths, deleting all but the <tt>Default</tt> rule from our Cherokee
configuration.</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><div class="title">Steps</div><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
First, access your virtual server configuration and go to the
  <tt>Basics</tt> tab. Add <tt>index.aspx,default.aspx</tt> to the list of
  <tt>Directory Indexes</tt>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Then, delete every erasable rule. The only remaining one should be
  the <tt>Default</tt> one.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Edit the rule, go to the <tt>Handler</tt> tab and select the FastCGI
  handler. Assign it the <em>mono</em> information source. As always, you can
  set up as many hosts as desired and Cherokee will balance the load
  among them. If you want to take the alternative path of configuring
  Mono through extensions instead of paths, simply define a rule that
  applies to the 11 extensions mentioned above. The handler
  configuration is completely identical. Either way, make sure the
  <tt>Check file</tt> option of the handler is enabled. This is very
  important. If it is not, FastCGI will not work and you will receive
  an <em>500 Internal Server Error</em>.

</div>
<div class="image-title">FastCGI handler</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>And that is all. Once you upload your ASP.NET application to
<em>/var/www</em> and launch Cherokee, you should be able to access your
application by pointing your web browser to, lets say
<tt>http://example.net/</tt>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For this recipe, the package asp.net2-examples (provided by Debian and
Ubuntu thanks to some APT magic) was used. If you were to copy the
examples to <tt>/var/www</tt> as final step of this tutorial, you should see that Mono is working.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock">

<img alt="media/images/cookbook_mono_demo.png" src="media/images/cookbook_mono_demo.png"/>
</div>
<div class="image-title">Demo in action</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When the package is installed, the examples will be placed in
<tt>/usr/share/asp.net2-demos</tt>. Copy those to <tt>/var/www</tt> and you are ready
to make the test.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Alternatively you can avoid copying any files and simply spawn the
FastCGI Mono Server with the real path of the examples, like this:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>fastcgi-mono-server2 --socket=tcp:8080 --address=127.0.0.1 --applications=/:/usr/share/asp.net2-demos</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In case you can’t find the mentioned examples, you could always copy
the following program to <tt>/var/www/index.aspx</tt> just to make sure your
Mono setup is working.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>&lt;%@ Page Language="C#" Debug="true" %&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
       &lt;h1&gt;Hello World!!!&lt;/h1&gt;
       &lt;%
          // This block will execute in the Render_Control method
          Response.Write("Check out the family tree: &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;");
          Response.Write(this.GetType().ToString());
          Response.Write(" which derives from: &lt;br&gt; ");
          Response.Write(this.GetType().BaseType.ToString());
          Response.Write(" which derives from: &lt;br&gt; ");
          Response.Write(this.GetType().BaseType.BaseType.ToString());
          Response.Write(" which derives from: &lt;br&gt; ");
          Response.Write(
            this.GetType().BaseType.BaseType.BaseType.ToString());
          Response.Write(" which derives from: &lt;br&gt; ");
          Response.Write(
            this.GetType().BaseType.BaseType.BaseType.BaseType.ToString());
       %&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</tt></pre>
