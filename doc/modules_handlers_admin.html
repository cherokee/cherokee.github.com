<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>This handler is used to create rules that can provide information
about the running server useful for System Administration.
When any such rule is matched, a
<a href="other_bundle_cherokee-tweak.html">cherokee-tweak</a> instance will have
full access to this data stream.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Note that providing real-real time information about the status of a
web server in production is a double edged blade. It is both a very
valuable tool for system administration <strong>and</strong> a severe security risk
if no precautions are taken. You are strongly encouraged to both
encrypt the channel and disable public access.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There are no parameters to be configured for this handle.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The information provided covers a wide spectrum: ports (secured and
non-secured), TX/RX status, connections, threads, backup mode and
selectable system traces such as the ones provided by CHEROKEE_TRACE.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Check the <a href="dev_debug.html">Debugging</a> section for more details on
this, and the section about
<a href="other_bundle_cherokee-tweak.html">cherokee-tweak</a> for specific usage
information.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Also, you should think of this handler as a web-service. In fact,
cherokee-tweak is just a client application using consuming
it. Writing custom client-apps that make use of this handler is almost
trivial, since commands can be issued from the command line using
<tt>curl</tt>.</p></div>
