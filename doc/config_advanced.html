		<div class="ulist">
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						KeepAlive:
						Enables the global keep-alive support for the client requests. It
						increases the client performance by reusing a connection for more
						than one request. It should most probably be turned on.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Max keepalive reqs:
						This limits the number of HTTP requests that can be served by each
						keepalive connection. Keepalive connections improve performance, but
						surpassing certain amount of requests per each connection is an
						indicator that something out of the ordinary is happening. This
						prevents the appearance of any problems related to these situations.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Chunked encoding:
						Enabled by default to try to keep enabled Keep-Alive.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Polling Method: This affects the internal file descriptor polling
						method among the ones supported by the OS. The full list of options
						is <tt>epoll()</tt>, <tt>kqueue</tt>, <tt>poll()</tt>, <tt>Solaris ports</tt>, <tt>select()</tt> and
						<tt>Win32</tt>. Only the alternatives available for your specific
						architectures are shown. If you don’t know what this is or how this
						affects performance, just choose <tt>Automatic</tt>. This will choose the
						most efficient one among the present at any given time.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Sendfile min/max size:
						These allow to configure the range of file sizes that can be sent
						with <tt>sendfile()</tt>. Default: [32768 Bytes - 2 GB].

		<div class="ulist">
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						Thread Number:
						Adjust the number of threads for Cherokee to work with. Increasing
						this will allow for better parallelization at the cost of system
						resources. Highly constrained environments such as embedded devices
						will probably be fine with just one. This doesn’t translate into
						just one connection at the time, since a thread can handle many.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Thread Policy:
						Defines the thread policy to be applied by the OS: FIFO, Round Robin
						or Dynamic.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						File descriptors:
						This can alter the number of file descriptors handled by the server
						should handle. The default value is what <tt>ulimit -n</tt> reports. An
						increase in this value improves performance under very high server load.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Listening queue length: This specifies the size of the incoming
						connection queue. It is the effective buffer of connections that
						will be served even if there are no connection slots available at
						the moment.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Reuse connections:
						Cherokee implements an intelligent mechanism to reuse connections if
						possible, allowing it to improve performance by not having to
						reinitialize structures in memory that can serve perfectly well for
						more than one time. It defaults to 20. Though this mechanism is an obvious
						improvement, reducing this limit is useful for cases when a sudden
						burst of connections happens. In those cases it doesn’t make much
						sense to keep reusing many more connections than those of an average
						load for any other moment.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Log flush time:
						Time interval in seconds to wait between log updates. Defaults to 10
						seconds.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Nonces clean up time:
						Time interval in seconds between Nonce cache clean ups. Defaults to
						60 seconds.

						Panic action:
						This specifies the program that will be called in case the server

						Cherokee. This in turn performs the actions specified in the
						<tt>CHEROKEE_PANIC_OUTPUT</tt> environment variable. If none is set, it will
						attempt to send an email to the system administrator with a
						backtrace of what happened. As a last resort, if no mailer is
