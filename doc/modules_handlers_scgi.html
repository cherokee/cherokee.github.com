<div class="paragraph"><p>The <tt>scgi handler</tt> allows Cherokee to communicate with SCGI programs.
The configuration parameters are exactly the same from the
<a href="modules_handlers_fcgi.html">FastCGI</a>, so check that section of the
documentation if you want to set up this handler.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The Simple Common Gateway Interface
(<a href="http://python.ca/scgi/protocol.txt">SCGI</a>) protocol is a project
to replace CGI and FastCGI with a simpler protocol to both implement
and manage.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In the end, SCGI offers the same performance as FastCGI (and better
than other methods), offers cross platform simultaneous support and is
simple to install, run, and configure.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It also supports simplified clustering on most POSIX systems for that
extra boost in concurrency, but whether you use it or not will be
mostly determined by your personal taste and experience.</p></div>
