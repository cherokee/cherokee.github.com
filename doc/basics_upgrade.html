			<p>If there is a prepackaged version of Cherokee for you platform of
				choice, we strongly encourage you to use it. Although upgrading
				Cherokee is not complicated, the prepackaged versions should make your
				upgrades much easier.

			<p>Refer to the <a href="basics_installation_unix.html#APT">APT</a> section of the

			<p>The current mechanism of choice to configure Cherokee did not exist
				prior to release 0.6. A lot has happened since then, and Cherokee has
				been constantly improving in terms of stability, efficiency and
				features.
			</p>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>If you happen to be running an old version of Cherokee and would like
				to keep your current configuration settings, you can upgrade your
				cherokee.conf file.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>Cherokee currently supports configuration versioning, so
				from now on, whenever a change is made to the configuration file
				format, Cherokee-Admin will be able to automatically convert yours to
				the new release. You simply have to load Cherokee-Admin and it will be
				converted once you proceed to saving it.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>There is also a command line utility that you can use to do the exact
				same thing. It is provided under
				<tt>$prefix/share/cherokee/admin/upgrade_config.py.</tt>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>In case you need to do this manually, the usage is as follows:</p>

		<div class="listingblock">
			<div class="content">
				<pre><tt>/usr/share/cherokee/admin/upgrade_config.py /etc/cherokee/cherokee.conf</tt></pre>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>Every effort is made to bulletproof the upgrade script. If an upgrade
				does not work for you, please send a bug report.  However, Cherokee is
				a very active project and has been steadily advancing and
				incorporating technical improvements. You should really be using
				<a href="other_bundle_cherokee-admin.html">cherokee-admin</a> to configure
				your system if you want to take full advantage of the new
				features. Even if the upgrade process is successful, you should use
				the new configuration file as a start point and go through the normal
				configuration process using
				<a href="other_bundle_cherokee-admin.html">cherokee-admin</a>.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>Also, as long as you are not using an ancient configuration file,
				every new cherokee-admin release will be able to upgrade the
				configuration automatically from previous versions whenever a format
				change has been required.
