			<p>Through this section you will be able to launch and stop the web
				server. It also provides some useful information about the server and
				the configuration status, as well as some hardware stats. Also, the
				lower right corner of the screen will allow you to shut-down
				Cherokee-Admin without leaving the web interface, which might be
				convenient particularly if you have launched it using
				<a href="other_bundle_cherokee-admin-launcher.html">cherokee-admin-launcher</a>.

			<p>This checkbox can be disabled for those who do not wish to interact at
				all with the outside World. Just leave it unchecked, and
				Cherokee-Admin will offer more or less the same capabilitites that it
				had to offer before the <a href="config_market.html">Cherokee Market</a>
				era. However, when this option is checked, the new
				<a href="config_market.html">Market</a> section will appear in the graphical
				interface, and the free <tt>Backup Service</tt> will be at your disposal.
