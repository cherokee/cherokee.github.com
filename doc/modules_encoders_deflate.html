<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>This compression encoder is similar to the
<a href="modules_encoders_gzip.html">gzip</a> encoder. The <tt>gzip</tt> compression
is technically superior to <tt>deflate</tt>, thus this one is not set up as a
default for new virtual servers.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A <strong>Compression Level</strong> can be optionally set within the range 0 to 9,
where 0 is no compression, 1 best speed, and 9 is best compression.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Just as with <tt>gzip</tt>, the encoding support is based on modules. The
configuration file must tell the server to load a module or it wonâ€™t
be supported.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Also, as with <tt>gzip</tt>, it is possible to specify which files can be
encoded and which ones are to be excluded.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The only reason to offer <tt>deflate</tt> encoding is for the rare cases in
which it is supported by clients that do not support <tt>gzip</tt>. No modern
web browser will lack this. However more than one encoder can be
offered simultaneously by Cherokee, so you have the choice to add or
not the support for <tt>deflate</tt>.</p></div>
