<div class="paragraph"><p>This section answers some general questions regarding the current
behavior of several parts of Cherokee that might lead to
missunderstandings.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Some scenarios require web traffic to be restricted on a virtual
server basd on incoming IP.  Although an IP/Subnet host match type is
present on the <tt>Host Match</tt> tab of virtual servers, this canâ€™t be used
as a security measure to enforce traffic restrictions. Its main
purpose is explained elsewhere in the documentation, and suffice it to
say that if this method were to be used, it could be easily overcomed by
forging the <tt>Host</tt> header.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you want to restrict the traffic of one of your virtual servers
based on the incoming IP, the best way to go is setting a non-final
rule on top of your behavior rule list of the virtual server. That
rule should match the forbidden IPs with an <tt>Incoming IP/Port</tt>-type
rule (such as <tt>(NOT Incoming IP: 127.0.0.1/8)</tt>), and could be handled
by custom error handler, or an appropriate redirection.</p></div>
