			<p>Every information source to be used by the web server is configured
				only once in this section. After that, any virtual server will be able
				to use as many as desired without having to set up the same thing over
				and over again for every one of the configured servers.
			</p>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>This section shows the configured information sources (<em>Known
				sources</em>), the usage of sources by every defined rule in your virtual
				servers (<em>Source usage</em>) and allows the addition and edition of
				sources.

			<p>There are two possible settings as <strong>information sources</strong>:</p>
		</div>
		<div class="olist arabic">
			<ol class="arabic">
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Remote</strong>: Cherokee will simply dispatch the request to the specified
						host. As many hosts as needed can be added, and Cherokee will simply
						apply the balancing strategy to which the information source is
						assigned among them. If for any reason the requests made to these
						hosts could not be performed, the processes would simply fail.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Local</strong>: As before, many hosts can be specified (despite the name,
						the selection is not limited to the localhost). This works the same
						way as the previous option. But in this case, if a request cannot be
						responded then, instead of failing directly, the command specified
						in the field <tt>Interpreter</tt> would be launched before reconnecting to
						try again. The most common use of this would be launching the
						service that should handle the request, but it is a flexible
						mechanism that in theory could allow you to reroute the information
						to allow you to serve SSH sessions via your webserver or any other
						neat tricks you can think of. If this field is specified then the
						parameter <tt>Spawning timeout</tt> can also be specified. If this limit is
						exceeded and the interpreter has not yet been launched, Cherokee
						will give up. The default value is 3 seconds.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>Note that because of Cherokee’s flexibility and modularity, sometimes
				and depending of the situation one or the other setting might not
				make much sense. In such occasions <tt>cherokee-admin</tt> will simply hide
				whatever options do not apply.

						<td class="content">Do not provide daemonizing options as part of the command to launch a
							given interpreter.
							Cherokee’s auto-spawning mechanism is very useful, since it can
							re-launch a local interpreter if for whatever reason the process had
							died unexpectedly. The launched interpreter is automatically
							daemonized, and <tt>stdout</tt> and <tt>stderr</tt> are conveniently handled in
							accordance to any logging setting you might have configured. Beware:
							some applications accept a parameter to daemonize themselves, but
							using such parameter will most likely interfere with Cherokee, so you
							are advised against that. There is no need for such parameters,
							stderr/stdout redirections, background-launching, etc.

						<td class="content">The information about source usage allows you to see which information
							sources are currently in use in whatever rule configured along your
							list of virtual servers. This is intended as a tool to let you know
							whether you can or cannot safely remove an information source from
							your list. When you do so, the source is also removed from the rule.
							For instance, if your PHP rule was balancing among two information
							sources, by deleting one of the sources in this section you would also
							be deleting it in the corresponding rule entry. Now the PHP rule would
							balance only with one information source. This is perfectly safe. The
							problem arises whenever you want to completely exhaust the list of
							sources being balanced. Since every balancer (a generic balancer or a
							FastCGI balancer, for example) needs at least one information source,
							the rule would be broken and Cherokee would fail to start. This is
							prevented by disabling the deletion of the last source of any rule. To
							eliminate such sources you will have to manually fix the rule by
							either setting up alternative information sources or by completely
							eliminating the rule.
