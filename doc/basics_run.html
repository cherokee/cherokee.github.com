			<p>There are several ways you can run Cherokee:</p>

		<div class="olist arabic">
			<ol class="arabic">
				<li>
					<p>
						Automatic start: this makes use of the mechanism offered by your OS
						that should have been configured when Cherokee was installed. It
						will run making use of the <a href="dev_cherokee.conf.html"><tt>cherokee.conf</tt></a>
						present in your system.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Guardian wrapper: The <a href="other_bundle_cherokee.html">cherokee</a> program
						comes as a standard part of the Cherokee bundle. It is a security
						mechanism that ensures Cherokee’s recovery in case of any system
						failure and wraps the calls to <tt>cherokee-worker</tt>. This is what is
						actually launched when Cherokee is automatically started.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Stand alone instance: Cherokee supports a series of parameters to
						launch it from the command line. Refer to the the appropriate
						documentation section about
						<a href="other_bundle_cherokee-worker.html"><tt>cherokee-worker</tt></a> to see the
						complete list of optional arguments.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Cherokee-Admin: The administration web interface allows you to
						configure and launch Cherokee. This is probably where you want to
						start if you have just installed the web server. Launch the
						<a href="other_bundle_cherokee-admin.html"><tt>cherokee-admin</tt></a> process and follow
						the <a href="config_walkthrough.html">Quickstart</a> section of the
						documentation.
					</p>
