<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Django is a fantastic high-level Python Web framework that can run
nicely with Cherokee and either the
<a href="modules_handlers_scgi.html">SCGI</a> or
<a href="modules_handlers_fcgi.html">FastCGI</a> handlers.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To properly set up Cherokee to use Django you will need a working
Django framework, which is not difficult at all to get ready. The
details vary from system to system. You can refer to the official
project’s documentation for more information on
<a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/install">how to install
Django</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There are two ways to deploy a Django project running on Cherokee. The
first one is the classical method and involves the usage of Flup, it
is the method documented in this recipe and has been the standard
method for years. Thousands of sites currently use this approach
successfully.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The other method involves using <a href="cookbook_uwsgi.html">uWSGI</a>. It is
a new, modern and feature-rich approach. There is a separate recipe
and wizard for that, so check it out. We can assure you it will be
worth your time. The instructions on how to set up the Framework are
the same, but the method in which Cherokee is configured varies.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There is a
<a href="../screencasts.html#django_flup">screencast</a>
available at the
<a href="../index.html">Cherokee-Project website</a> to
demonstrate how easy it is to use the Django wizard.</p></div>

<h3 id="_preparing_the_framework">Preparing the framework</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>On Debian based systems this will be enough:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt># apt-get install python-django python-flup</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You will need Flup because it implements the standard interface
between Python Web applications and Web servers, so you will be using
it to run your web application either as FastCGI or SCGI.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Once you are done with that, you must deploy your Django project:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>$ cd /var/www
$ django-admin startproject example</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This will create the basic structure into a new directory called
<tt>example</tt>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It is important to ensure that <tt>manage.py</tt> has execution permissions.
If it does not, you will only have to set them by running:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>chmod a+rx manage.py</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Now you are ready to configure Cherokee.</p></div>
<h3 id="_preparing_cherokee">Preparing Cherokee</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You can either do it by hand, or you can use the appropriate wizard
for a hassle-free configuration.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To do so, simply access the <tt>Virtual Servers</tt> section in
<tt>Cherokee-Admin</tt>, and click on the <tt>Add</tt> button at the top of the
panel to show the list of available wizards. <tt>Django</tt> is located under
the <tt>Platforms</tt> category. You can use this wizard both within your
<tt>Virtual Servers</tt> list (in which case a new virtual server is
configured), and from the <tt>Rule Management</tt> button on the <tt>Behavior</tt>
tab inside one of your virtual servers. In this last scenario, the
Django project will be accessible under the specified web directory of
the selected virtual server.</p></div>

<img alt="media/images/admin_vservers_wizard.png" src="media/images/admin_vservers_wizard.png"/>
</div>
<div class="image-title">Wizards</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Simply fill in the required fields. <tt>Project Directory</tt> applies to the
path where your Django application is located, while <tt>Document Root</tt>
applies to the directory that contains non-Django related files, such
as any static content.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>That’s it. You can stop reading now. Go enjoy your Django application
running on Cherokee.</p></div>
<h3 id="_setting_up_cherokee_by_hand">Setting up Cherokee by hand</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The following information details the steps needed to configure
Cherokee by hand, which is not the recommended option. The wizards are
constantly being updated as new releases of the software become
available, while the recipe might become somehow more outdated given
enough time.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It is not difficult, though. You only need to know how to spawn the
FastCGI or SCGI, which is done with a script provided by your project
called <tt>manage.py</tt>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Django can be run on a TCP port or on a Unix socket. In our example we
will be launching it as threaded server on a TCP port with SCGI
protocol. This is accomplished with the following command, which is
what we will have to set up in <tt>cherokee-admin</tt>.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>./manage.py runfcgi method=threaded host=127.0.0.1 port=3033 protocol=scgi</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The process is fairly simple. Set up a new rule for this new path and
manage it with the SCGI handler. If you wanted to use the FastCGI
handler instead you would only have to omit the last parameter and
FastCGI would be used by default. The configuration of the handler is
exactly the same for SCGI and FastCGI.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Once you have created the new rule for your <tt>/var/www/example</tt>
directory, choose the desired handler and use the following
configuration.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">Common CGI options</div><p>Under <tt>Common CGI options</tt> make sure to check the <tt>Error handler</tt> box and
uncheck <tt>Check file</tt>. This is to prevent possible errors with the
<tt>INFO_PATH</tt> generation that can happen when an application, in this
case <em>Django</em>, manages the whole subtree. This is mentioned in the
<a href="modules_handlers_cgi.html">Common CGI</a> section of the
documentation. It is a good idea to enable the <tt>Error handler</tt>
checkbox since it will help you determine if an error is associated
with your Django application or with Cherokee. This, however, is not
required.</p></div>

<div class="image-title">SCGI handler</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">SCGI specific</div><p>Under <tt>SCGI specific</tt> make sure to add the hosts providing the
service. This is done by adding one or more information sources.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Note that you will have to manually launch the <tt>spawner</tt> if
you use a <tt>Remote host</tt> as <tt>Information source</tt> instead of a <tt>Local
interpreter</tt>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You will simply have to add as many sources as needed, for instance
our example uses one nicknamed <tt>django1</tt>, created as <strong>local
interpreter</strong> with these parameters on port 3033.</p></div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You can set up as many hosts as desired and Cherokee will balance the
load among them.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Once everything is done you can check if Django is really
working. Just navigate to the path configured by your rule,
<a href="http://localhost/example">http://localhost/example</a> for instance, and you should see some notes
about your recently created project.</p></div>

</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="sidebar-content">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Should you wish to deploy your Django application directly instead of
through <tt>manage.py</tt> this could be easily achieved. Just remember to
add the appropriate command used to launch the interpreter in the
relevant <tt>information source</tt>, and it will be executed. As noted in
the warning on the documentation about
<a href="config_info_sources.html#daemonization">Information Sources</a>, Cherokee
is smart enough to daemonize the backend during the spawning process,
so you must avoid any manual daemonization on your part to prevent the
processess from interfering.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is done adding the appropriate parameter to the <tt>runfastcgi</tt>
method of <tt>django.core.servers.fastcgi</tt> in your script.</p></div>
