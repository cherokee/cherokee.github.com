			<p>Cherokee is very light, completely modular and it can be tailored to
				your specific needs. As such, disk requirements will vary depending on
				the options selected for the building process. A static build for
				embedded devices can occupy as little as 200KB, give or take.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>In terms of processing power, it has been known to work with as
				little as 133Mhz ARM processors. It could very well work on something
				smaller, but we haven’t really had the chance to try it out.

			<p>Cherokee has no dependencies besides a standard libc. Everything else
				is optional. Obviously anything beyond serving mere static content
				must be available for Cherokee to correctly execute the task. This
				means you will need PHP if you want Cherokee to serve PHP dynamic
				content, the rrdtool package if you intend to collect statistics to
				render usage graphs, MySQL or LDAP development libraries if you want
				built-in support for these as authentication mechanisms for protected
				content, ffmpeg development libraries to build the streaming module,
				and so on.

			<p>If you intend to build Cherokee from source however, you will need
				several tools and libraries.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="ulist">
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Building tools:</strong> Cherokee is built on top of the autoconf and
						automake tools, hence your system has to have some basic system
						programs like an sh shell, make and an ANSI C compiler. We have
						compiled Cherokee in various platforms with different compilers, so
						it shouldn’t be a problem.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Python:</strong> Cherokee has an administration web interface written in
						Python, so if you intend to use cherokee-admin you will need this.
						For disk space constrained environments this won’t be an issue
						since you would probably want to make a minimal install in your
						destination host, preconfigured elsewhere. This programming language
						is also used to generate the documentation, and Cherokee includes a
						number of Quality Assurance tests written in it as well. If you are
						planning to contribute code into the project, or you just want to
						test everything is working in the server, you will need a Python
						interpreter installed on your system. The main Python releases
						targeted by our developers are 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6. Anything other than
						that is not guaranteed to work at the moment.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						If you are building Cherokee in a non-POSIX compliant platform such
						as Windows, you will need a POSIX threads implementation. Although
						you can disable the usage at compilation time and do without this,
						it will have a dramatic impact in scalability.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						If you want to make a build that serves secure content, you will
						need TLS libraries. Cherokee ships with support for the OpenSSL
						backend, but the architecture is completely modular and any other
						backend can be implemented. You need to have the development files
						of the chosen backend libraries in order to build a package that
						suits your needs.
					</p>
				</li>
