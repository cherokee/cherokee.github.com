<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend Framework</a> is a PHP framework
focused on building more secure, reliable, and modern Web 2.0
applications &amp; web services.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It is essential that Cherokee supports PHP before starting with this
recipe. That should not be a problem since it comes preconfigured by
default. However, you can follow the <a href="cookbook_php.html">setting up
PHP</a> recipe for further hints on fine tuning this feature.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To make sure the recipe works, we’ll be using the demo provided by the
<a href="http://framework.zend.com/docs/quickstart">Zend Framework
Quickstart</a>. Last time this document was edited, it was
<a href="http://framework.zend.com/demos/ZendFrameworkQuickstart-20090430.tar.gz">demo
20090430</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Uncompress its contents to a directory and set up the <tt>public</tt>
subdirectory as your web document root. In our example, it will be
<tt>/var/www/demo/public</tt>.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>user@cherokee:/var/www/demo$ ls
application  data  library  public  scripts</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <tt>library</tt> directory is empty and should contain the Zend Framework
files. Download it from the
<a href="http://framework.zend.com/download">official page</a> and copy it to
the appropriate location. Follow the Quickstart for more details on
setting up the framework. We will concentrate on the Cherokee side.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So now that we have the files in place, we’ll just create the needed
rules for the web server. Specially important will be the rewrite
rules. From the Zend Framework</p></div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="sidebar-content">
<div class="paragraph"><p>This set of rewrite rules specify that if the file exists under the
document root directory, it should simply be served as a static
resource. Otherwise, the request is for dynamic content and should be
rewritten to our index.php script. Since all requests for non-static
content will be rewritten to it, the index.php script serves as the
entry point to our application.</p></div>
</div></div>
<h3 id="wizard_configuration">Configure Cherokee using the Wizard</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Cherokee is shipped with a configuration <tt>Wizard</tt> that can be used
both to deploy the application under a dedicated <tt>Virtual Server</tt> and
under a web folder from one already existent.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Launch cherokee-admin, and proceed to the
<a href="config_virtual_servers.html">Virtual servers</a> section.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Now you can either enter the chosen one to install under a web folder,
or directly click on the <tt>Add</tt> button of the <tt>Virtual Servers</tt> panel
to create a customised virtual server. In any case you will find the
wizard under the <tt>Platforms</tt> category.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>After that you will be asked for the minimal information required to
correctly configure your server in a totally transparent way.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>And that’s it. You are done with the configuration! You can now access
your application.</p></div>

it to work as intended.</p></div>
