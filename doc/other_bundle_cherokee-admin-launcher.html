<div class="paragraph"><p>This is a launcher for the administration user interface,
<a href="other_bundle_cherokee-admin.html">cherokee-admin</a>. It will check
for port availability, launch <tt>cherokee-admin</tt>, and automatically open
a web browser to access it.  Since it is a wrapper, it accepts exactly
the same parameters, but provides several extra features that makes
this the most convenient way of using <tt>cherokee-admin</tt>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This tools is intended for local use, and is the natural action to
associate with a launch icon to conviniently deploy <tt>cherokee-admin</tt>
from within any desktop environment. Since this is the intended use,
it will automatically provide the one-time login details to the web
browser, removing the need to copy and paste the user and password. Of
course this step is not necessary when invoked with the
<tt>--unsecure</tt> parameter, but this is not recommended except for
development purposes.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Refer to the <a href="other_bundle_cherokee-admin.html">cherokee-admin
documentation</a> for more in-depth explanations of all the parameters
and options.</p></div>

<strong>SIGNALS</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
       You can send the SIGHUP signal to cherokee-admin-launcher to
       make it relaunch a web browser conviniently authenticated
       agains cherokee-admin. This is useful in case you closed the
       web browser and wished to access cherokee-admin again without
       restarting it, since manual access would require you to provide
       the one-time login details that you wouldnâ€™t have.
