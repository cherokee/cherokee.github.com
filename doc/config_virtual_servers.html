			<p>A <em>Virtual Server</em> is an abstraction mechanism that allows you to define
				a custom number of parameters and rules that have to be applied to one
				or more domains.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>In a Cherokee server there must be at least one virtual server named
				<tt>default</tt>, and there is no maximum number. You can define and delete
				as many as you want, with the sole exception of <tt>default</tt> which must
				be present always.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>When the server receives a request it will try to match the domain
				name specified in the virtual server that should handle it. In case no
				virtual server matches the request, <tt>default</tt> will be used.
			</p>

			<div class="image-title">Host Match</div>
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>This section of the admin is divided in a left panel and main contents
				section on the right.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>The panel displays the list of virtual servers, which can be filtered
				according to the matching criteria specified in the <tt>Virtual Server
				Filtering</tt> box, and has two buttons at the top that correspond, from
				left to right, to <tt>Add New Virtual Server</tt> and <tt>Clone Selected
				Virtual Server</tt>.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>Whenever you select a virtual server, the main content area displays
				information relevant to the chosen host.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>You should be aware that the order in which the virtual servers are
				listed is not arbitrary. The list is evaluated from top to bottom
				whenever Cherokee receives a request, and the first virtual server
				that matches the given request will be the one used to send a reply.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>You can drag and drop the elements of the list to change the order in
				which the matches are evaluated.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>The <tt>default</tt> virtual server is always at the bottom and cannot be
				dragged. As mentioned above, if a request doesn’t match any other
				virtual server, it falls through all the way to the default one to
				ensure no requests are left unattended. The most simple usage
				scenarios usually involve only the default virtual host, and do not
				require additional virtual servers.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>The entries on the <tt>Virtual Server</tt> list are composed of two elements:</p>
		</div>
		<div class="ulist">
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Name</strong>
					</p>
					<div class="paragraph">
						<p>An alias that is used to identify the virtual server and is the value
							used when filtering the virtual servers to be listed. The domain names
							handled by the virtual server should be specified later in the virtual
							server details page.
						</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Document Root</strong>
					</p>
					<div class="paragraph">
						<p>This is the directory from which Cherokee will serve files. For
							example, if the Document Root is <tt>/var/www</tt>, then a client’s request
							for <tt>http://www.example.com/index.html</tt> refers to
							<tt>/var/www/index.html</tt> on the server.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="paragraph">
						<p>In the simplest case, the server might return the contents of the file
							to the client. But Cherokee provides a richer mechanism of behaviors,
							based on the the URL. Behaviors are described
							<a href="#behavior">below</a>. For now, just know that the combination of a
							URL and the Document Root specifies the match (for instance, a file on
							the server), but does not specify how that file will be served. Note
							that not all rules will necessarily match files to be sent to the
							client, so the Document Root is not always used.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="paragraph">
						<p>This is controlled by behavior rules. The set of rules is checked from
							the highest to the lowest possible priority. Once a rule is matched,
							the server appends the path from the requested URL to the document
							root to make the path to the document. If it is a directory, this
							information is used. If other rules apply to a parent directory, those
							are applied as well without overwriting the original behavior:
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="listingblock">
						<div class="content">
							<pre><tt>        http://www.example.com/index.html refers to /var/www/index.html</tt></pre>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="paragraph">
						<p>This might seem complicated but it’s actually simple to
							understand. For example suppose you had a directory called /secret
							that was protected with authentication, and there was also a rule with
							higher priority for /secret/cgi that only specified to use the CGI
							handler. Under these circumstances, if a request was received for
							/secret/cgi/something then the CGI handler would be taken and it would
							inherit the authentication specified for /secret.
						</p>
					</div>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph">
			<p><strong>Add New Virtual Server</strong> allows the creation of additional virtual
				hosts, either manually or by using any of the available configuration
				<a href="config_wizards.html">wizards</a>. These are configuration assistants
				that will allow you to set up a new virtual server tailored to some
				application’s specific needs. The wizard will ask for some basic
				values, such as the name of the new virtual server or anything that
				might be needed to make its job, like deploying a Django application,
				installing Wordpress or whatever task you might have chosen. The
				wizards can also be run on a per-server basis, in which case instead
				of creating a new dedicated virtual server, the required changes will
				be added to the existing one. To use the wizards in this manner you
				will have to trigger them from the <tt>Behavior</tt> panel instead of the
				<tt>Virtual Server Panel</tt>. This <tt>Behavior</tt> panel is specific to a given
				virtual host, and can be activated using the <tt>Rule Management</tt> button
				of the <tt>Behavior</tt> tab. You can read more about automatic configuration
				on the <a href="config_wizards.html">wizards</a> section. Regardless of them
				being used from the <tt>Virtual Server</tt> panel or the <tt>Behavior</tt> panel,
				one or more rules will be created to suit a particular scenario. The
				main difference will lay on the wizard creating a new virtual server
				or just customizing an existing one, depending on the instantiation
				context.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph">
			<p><strong>Clone Selected Virtual Server</strong> is simply a matter of selecting a
				target name and a source virtual server currently present. Every
				setting will be duplicated. From then onwards changes applied to any
				of them, be it the original or the copied Virtual Servers, will only
				apply to the implicated one. This is a great way to set up complex
				domains, since you can use the existing ones as templates to be
				refined with further work.

				the resources exist, the server will reply according to the handler
				behavior.

			<p>There is a special case in which the directory index entry starts with
				a slash. For example, /cgi-bin/index.pl. In that case, it will use it

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>Hint: Although it is rare, there are some web-broswsers out there that
				do not seem to convert the FQDN to lowercase before sending the
				requests. This mainly happens with built-in browsers or very-early
				implementations. Even in those cases it is possible to have
				case-insensitive host matching by using regular-expression
				matching. For example, if your domain name was <tt>Example.com</tt> and
				were dealing with one such browser, you would have to prepend <strong>(?i)</strong>
				to your regular expression. That in turn would perform a
				case-insensitive evaluation, effectively solving the problem.

				priorities of such hosts. When it finds a match, it stops the
				evaluation and starts matching the specific rules from that virtual
				host to send the appropriate response.

						Providing the PEM-encoded files is mandatory for both <tt>Certificate</tt>
						and <tt>Certificate key</tt> fields. Providing the <tt>CA List</tt> and the
						<tt>Client Certs</tt> is optional. The trusted CA certificates file should
						be a single file with all the certificates concatenated. The <tt>Client
						Certs</tt>, also PEM-encoded, is used to check the client
						certificates. You can read more about
						<a href="cookbook_ssl.html#ssl-support">enabling SSL support</a> on the
						SSL/TLS section of the documentation.

						If you have several virtual servers, the <tt>Security</tt> section must be
						configured for the <tt>default</tt> virtual server besides any other
						virtual server you want to support HTTPS. This makes sense, since by
						enabling the feature in any one of them you are opening the HTTPS
						port in your host, and receiving HTTPS requests for a virtual server
						that does not provide the service can not be handled correctly.
						This situation can be dealt with in several ways, none of which are
						really elegant in design: falling back to HTTP, issuing an error
						that is likely to restart the HTTPS handshake, etc. The approach
						taken by Cherokee is at least coherent, folding back to the
						<tt>default</tt> virtual server. Of course, to do so it needs correct
						<tt>Security</tt> settings to provide an HTTPS stream, as has just been
						mentioned.
