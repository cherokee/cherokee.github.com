<div class="paragraph"><p><tt>cherokee-tweak</tt> is a swiss army knife that allows to perform several
administrative tasks from the command line. It can connect to a
running Cherokee instance, be it in the local computer or at a remote
location, and request it to perform several actions.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>These actions are:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>

<strong>DESCRIPTION</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
       cherokee-tweak connects to a running cherokee instance, either  local  or
       remote, and requests it to perform one of several actions.
</p>

<strong>COMMANDS</strong>

<dd>
<div class="dlist"><dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">
info
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
               Prints info about the server status

<dt class="hdlist1">
sources
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
               Prints a list of the information sources
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
kill-source
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
               Kill a remote information source, specified by its reported ID
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
logrotate
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
               Rotates a local (<strong>and only local</strong>) log file specified by PATH.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
trace
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
               Manipulates the tracing mechanism. TRACE should be the
               string that specifies the modules to be traced, and
               Cherokee must have been compiled with the
               --enable-trace option for this to work. Everything
               traceable with CHEROKEE_TRACE can also be traced this
               way.

URL
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
               Required before any command. This is the URL where the
               administrative interface can be found.  This target
               must be defined previously in cherokee-admin, enabling
               a "Remote Administration" type handler (Virtual
               Servers→Behavior→Rule Management→Add new rule, and
               then Handler→"Remote Administration").  The definition
               of a security mechanism is highly encouraged.

<strong>OPTIONS</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
       cherokee-tweak accepts the following options:
</p>
<div class="dlist"><dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">
-u,  --user=STRING
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
               Specifies the user name with which to identify to the server
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
-p,  --password=STRING
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
               Specifies the password with which to identify to the server
</p>
</dd>
</dl></div>
</dd>
</dl></div>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To use <tt>cherokee-tweak</tt>, an administrative interface must be defined
within <a href="other_bundle_cherokee-admin.html">cherokee-admin</a>. That is, you
must define a path managed by the handler <tt>Remote
Administration</tt>. This can be done through the <em>Virtual Servers</em> option,
in <em>Behavior</em> and using the <em>Add new rule</em> option.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Please note that while you are at it, the definition of a security
(through the <em>Security</em> tab) is highly encouraged. Although you have
the choice to, you should never use <em>None</em> as security mechanism
since this would leave your system exposed to third parties using
<tt>cherokee-tweak</tt>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Also note that the usage of the <tt>trace</tt> command has no effect unless
Cherokee is compiled with the <tt>--enable-trace</tt>. This is a debugging
option and it is unlikely to be present in binary version of Cherokee
not specifically compiled with this in mind.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Every module traceable with CHEROKEE_TRACE can also be traced this
way. Refer to the <a href="dev_debug.html">"Debugging"</a> section of the
documentation for more information on this matter.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Keep in mind one important thing: when the <tt>trace</tt> command is
specified, <tt>cherokee-tweak</tt> activates the tracing functionality within
the <tt>cherokee</tt> instance. It does not provide tracing of its own. This
means the debugging information will appear in the machine that is
actually running the <tt>cherokee</tt> instance. This may or may not be the
same that is running the <tt>cherokee-tweak</tt> process.</p></div>
