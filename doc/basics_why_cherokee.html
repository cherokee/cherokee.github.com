			<p>Welcome to the Cherokee 1.0 documentation. Cherokee is a
				high-performance web server. It is very fast, flexible and easy to
				configure. In fact, it is the fastest web server there is. Check out
				the <a href="http://www.cherokee-project.com/benchmarks.html">benchmarks</a>
				and see for yourself. It offers support for the widespread
				technologies nowadays:
				FastCGI, SCGI, PHP, CGI, SSI, TLS and SSL encrypted connections,
				Virtual hosts, Authentication, on the fly encoding, Load Balancing,
				Apache compatible log files, Data Base Balancer, downtime-free updates
				and upgrades, Reverse HTTP Proxy, and much more.

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>It is highly efficient, extremely lightweight and provides rock solid
				stability. Among its many features there is one that deserves special
				credit: a user friendly interface called
				<a href="other_bundle_cherokee-admin.html">cherokee-admin</a> that is provided for a
				no-hassle configuration of every single feature of the server. This
				administration interface allows you to configure the web server
				without having to worry about editing a text file written with a
				certain syntax.

			<p>Unlike many other web servers out there, Cherokee gracefully handles
				many concurrent connections, has a low memory footprint, and provides
				load balancing facilities. As such, it is suitable for usage among a
				wide variety of systems, from tiny embedded devices to huge enterprise
				grade infrastructures. It is also multi-platform, offering native
				performance for Unix, Linux and Windows systems.

			<p>By simply upgrading your existing web server to Cherokee, you can
				literally multiply your existing hardware’s performance, extending its
				life cycle or allowing you to have a smaller, more efficient, compact
				and easier to maintain IT infrastructure.

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>Best of all, Cherokee is free software, has a thoroughly designed
				architecture, is completely modular and has a clean and neat code
				base. Anyone and everyone can have access to the code for study and
				tinkering, thus allowing you to customize, modify, or extend everything
				to suit specific needs. It is also very actively maintained, and every
				interesting feature request is carefully considered.
