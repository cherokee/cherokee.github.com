<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Setting up <a href="http://www.concrete5.org/">Concrete5</a> with Cherokee is really
easy. A configuration wizard is provided that can either be used to
install Concrete5 as a new dedicated Virtual Server, or to set it up
inside a Directory.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This recipe contains three sections detailing how to:
. Configure Cherokee for either installation mode using the Wizard.
. Install Concrete5 v3.3.1 which is the last one available at the time
of writing.
. Configure Cherokee manually.</p></div>
<h3 id="wizard_configuration">Configure Cherokee using the Wizard</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Two common scenarios are contemplated: installation on a dedicated
virtual server (<a href="http://concrete5.example.net/">http://concrete5.example.net/</a>, for instance) or under a
subdirectory on an existing virtual server (as could be
<a href="http://example.net/concrete5/">http://example.net/concrete5/</a>).</p></div>
<h4 id="cherokee_vserver">Setting up Concrete5 as a new Virtual Server</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The first step would be to go to the virtual server list page. Once in
there, click on the <tt>Add</tt> button at the top of the panel to show the
list of available wizards.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Now, you will have to select the <tt>CMS</tt> category, and run the Concrete5
wizard.  At this stage the Concrete5 wizard will ask you for some basic
parameters about the installation. It will try to auto-fill as many
entries of the form as possible.  For instance, if it finds Concrete5
installed in a standard location it will use that path as the default
directory.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The new virtual server will be created after this form is submitted.
The virtual server configuration will cover the vast majority of the
cases. Most probably it will cover your needs, although you are free
to modify it as you will.</p></div>
<h4 id="cherokee_dir">Setting up Concrete5 inside a Directory</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Concrete5 can also be configured inside a directory. Let’s suppose we
want to set up Concrete5 inside the <tt>/blog</tt> directory of one of our
virtual servers.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In this case, the first thing you will have to do is to enter the
virtual server configuration you’d like to configure Concrete5
in. Visit the <tt>Behavior</tt> tab, use the <tt>Rule Management</tt> button and
click on the <tt>Add</tt> button at the top of the panel.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img alt="media/images/admin_vserver_wizard.png" src="media/images/admin_vserver_wizard.png"/>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>As in the previous case, this wizard will ask some very basic
information, including the public web directory where Concrete5 will be
set up and the local Concrete5 source directory.</p></div>
<h3 id="package_installation">Installing Concrete5</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Once Cherokee is ready, only the database issue remains to be able to
install Concrete5. Log in to MySQL: <tt>mysql -u root -p</tt></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>And create the database for Concrete5. We will be using the name
<em>concrete5</em>, the user <em>concrete5user</em> and the password <em>concrete5password</em>, but
you should set up your own.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>CREATE DATABASE concrete5;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON concrete5.* TO concrete5user@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'concrete5password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON concrete5.* TO concrete5user@localhost.localdomain IDENTIFIED BY 'concrete5password';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
quit;</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Then point your web browser to the point specified when you ran the
wizard (i.e. <tt>http://localhost/concrete5</tt>, <tt>http://example.com/</tt>, etc)
and follow the instructions provided by the Concrete5 installer.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There is not much else you must do for Cherokee to work with
Concrete5. If you follow the Concrete5 installer’s instructions -providing
valid database information in most cases will suffice-, you will be
done in an instant.</p></div>
