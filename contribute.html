			<h1>Contributing with the Cherokee Project</h1>

			<p>The Cherokee Project is a diverse community of people from
			around the world. You don't have to be a networking guru or a
			skilled C developer to get involved.</p>

			<p>Come join our community, and contribute in any way you
			like:</p>

			<p><strong>Helping Users</strong>:
			There are several active
			communities where you can discuss what is going on in Cherokee and
			help out other Cherokee users. We have mailing lists, IRC channels
			and forums. Please have a look at the
			<a href="/community.html">communication channels</a> for an
			overview.</p>

			<p><strong>Localization</strong>:
			Get involved by making Cherokee available in your language. You are
			welcome to contribute with any of the existing translations. The
			following <a href="/download/trunk/cherokee.pot">Pot file</a> is
			available for new translations as well.</p>

			Developers can help Cherokee by adding new features, making our
			technology faster and making development easier for others.</p>

			<p><strong>Marketing</strong>:

			Web towards efficiency, scalability, and management simplicity.</p>

			coordinating activities for special marketing
			initiatives.</p>



			<h2>Cherokee Contributor Agreement</h2>

			<p>Before we can incorporate significant contributions,
			certain legal requirements must be met.</p>

			<p>We believe it is important to continue distributing
			Cherokee under a <a href="/license.html">Free Software
			license</a> and a unified copyright, so both the project and
			its users are as safe against legal threats.</p>

			<p>Everybody who contributes code to Cherokee is going to be
			asked to sign a Contribute Agreement. The main to reasons for
			requiring contributors to sign this document are: First, it
			protects the project against any legal issue as to the
			origins and ownership of any particular piece of code
			contributed.</p>

			<p>Second, the Contributor Agreement also ensures that once
			you have provided a contribution, you cannot try to withdraw
			permission for its use at a later date. People and companies
			can therefore use Cherokee, confident that they will not be
			asked to stop using pieces of the code at a later date.</p>

			<p>Please, follow the following steps to submit us your
			Contributor Agreement:</p>

			<p><strong>Download the Document</strong>:
			It is available as
			<a href="/static/doc/Cherokee_Contribution_Agreement_v1.pdf">PDF</a>
			and <a href="/static/doc/Cherokee_Contribution_Agreement_v1.odt">OpenDocument</a>
			files.</p>

			<p><strong>Sign it</strong>: Print out the document and sign it.</p>

			<p><strong>Submit it</strong>: Scan and email the document to
			alvaro@alobbs.com</p>
